# React Native CardinalBotics App
An app built in React Native that allows a user to log in and out of the [Cardinal Hours Server](https://github.com/lr1729/CardinalHoursServer) on a user's personal device.<br>
Works on Android ([APK provided in releases](https://github.com/malee31/ReactNativeCardinalBoticsApp/releases)) and on a [browser as a website](https://malee31.github.io/ReactNativeCardinalBoticsApp/) <br>
Untested but theoretically works on IOS.

# Usage
The first time the app/site is opened, you will be redirected to the login page and prompted for a password that you have registered on the server.<br>
After entering it in, the password will be verified and saved to the device used.<br>
You can then open the home page through the menu where you can sign in or out.<br>
After your first time using the app, opening the app will start you on the homepage instead of the login page and your password will be used from your device's storage.<br>
There are other pages available on the menu so feel free to explore them and use them as you see fit!
